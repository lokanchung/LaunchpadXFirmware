# Launchpad X Modified Firmware
Slightly Tweaked version of stock LPX Firmware.

## Features
- Removes Vegas Mode
- [Planned] More sensitive pad

I'm just trying to fix small annoying things that Novation won't change. This is personal project. No other features are planned. 
Use Novation Components to roll back to stock firmware.
